					<div className="two__left-content">A Mostbet cashier is an individual who runs the betting cashier app. The cashiers act as a guide for placing bets and can be characterised as brokers working on behalf of the company.

					<h2 className="two__right-title title">MOSTBET SERVICE</h2>
					<div className="two__right-content">
						Since players use Mostbet services through a cashier, the cashier, who represents the bookmaker company, receives a generous reward. Thus, cashiers receive compensation from Mostbet for their guide role between the bookmaker and clients.
